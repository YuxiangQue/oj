     * Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear

     * For example:
     * Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].
     * Note:
     * 1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
     * 2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
